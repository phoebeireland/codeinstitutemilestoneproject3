# Testing the Site


All HTML pages and CSS files were tested using the HTML and CSS Validator from W3.
* Link to the [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org./) used
* Link to the [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used

## Manual Testing

Using the Chrome Inspect tool, the following aspects of the website were tested:
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 

The EmailJS extenstion was tested using a sample email address and sample message.
* The result of this test was that the EmailJS service sent an email to the connected email address saying that a message was submitted.
* Also, an Auto-Reply email was successfully sent to the email address provied in the form. 


## Small Problems (that were fixed)
* For some reason, the background image was being really difficult and was refusing to fit the page. This was eventually fixed by adding a couple of lines to the css code relating to the background image size (cover), background-repeat (no-repeat) and background-attachment (fixed).
